This is the [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) system with some popular extension modules packaged in a self-contained Mac app.

It's new and work in progress. I am currently looking for testing and feedback. You can get the current build (large download, about 100MB) from: http://cdn.entropy.ch/software/ipython-notebook/IPython%20Notebook%201.3.zip
